                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You play as Laykha Balindong. Struggling for 
                        inspiration, you end up in a museum by an artist only <br>
                        known as "Celda". The museum has only a few attendees, 
                        though unsual as the artist was relatively <br> popular. 
                        As you explore their artworks you see 5 stone statues as 
                        their star exhibit. "Red, Orange, <br> Yellow, Green, Blue." 
                        You feel uncomfortable yet feel inspired to draw them 
                        and their unique styles. <br> You turn your back to the 
                        exhibit. The lights turn off. You turn back confused. 
                        The statues aren't <br> there anymore. You look around the 
                        museum and find 4 people and 1 dead body. Find who did 
                        it and <br> escape. Your decisions will affect the story.
